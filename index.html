    <p><i><strong><ins>Albert Einstein (1879–1955)</ins></strong> was a theoretical physicist and one of the most influential scientists in history. Here are some key points about his life and contributions:</i></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><em>Early Life:</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire.</li>
                <li>He showed an early interest in science and mathematics and struggled with the traditional education system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3><em>Special Theory of Relativity:</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1905, Einstein published the special theory of relativity, introducing the famous equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, which describes the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m).</li>
                <li>His theory revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3><em>Nobel Prize:</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Einstein was awarded the <mark>Nobel Prize in Physics </mark>in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle-like properties of light.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <dt><b>Einstein's objections to <ins>quantum mechanics</ins></b></dt>
        <dd>Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God "<del>is not playing at dice</del>". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><b>Bohr versus Einstein</b></dt>
        <dd>The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox</h3>
    <p>Einstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics. While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930. Einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other. The quantum-mechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction. If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the Schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction. But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is. Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object. Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast. Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. Because the true "physical condition" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it.    <a style="color:red; text-decoration:none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">More Information</a></p>
